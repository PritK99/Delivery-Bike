## About The Project

In this theme, we will develop a Self-Balancing Bike, which will deliver various items throughout the cityscape. The delivery order will be decided by the priority of the package, thus posing a challenge in path planning. While development, we will learn the basics of the Control System and LQR controller design. The main challenges faced in this theme will be:

1) Balancing of 2-wheeled Delivery Bike
2) Autonomous Navigation of Delivery Bike
3) Pickup and delivery in the arena

Learnings: Robot Simulation (CoppeliaSim), Control Systems, Euler-Lagrange Mechanics, Linear Quadratic Regulator, Lua Programming, Octave Programming, 3D Designing

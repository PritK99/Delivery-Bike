## Task 0A
In this task, we had to install Coppeliasim, Octave. We also had to set up a conda environment. After that, we had to perform some basic tests to check whether our installations were successful or not.

## Task 0B
In this task, we had to solve a system of non-linear equations to find the equilibrium points and then check the stability of the system at the given equilibrium points using Octave.

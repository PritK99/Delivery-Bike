# Task 0

## Task 0A: Software installation

In this task, we had to install Coppeliasim, Octave and miniconda in our systems. We also had to run some tests to check the installations we have done in previous sections and submit the output files generated during those tests.

## Task 0B: Modeling of Non-Linear Dynamical Systems - Part I

In this task, we solved a system of non-linear equations to find the equilibrium points and then check the stability of the system at the given equilibrium points using Octave.
